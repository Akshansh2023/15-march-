    "Unsupervised learning can be useful in anomaly detection by allowing the system to identify unusual patterns or behaviors that do not conform to the expected norm. Anomaly detection is a type of data analysis that seeks to identify patterns or behaviors that deviate from what is considered normal or expected. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used in this process by analyzing large data sets to identify patterns and clusters that can be used to differentiate normal data from anomalous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common technique for unsupervised anomaly detection is clustering, where data points are grouped together based on their similarity to each other. Clustering algorithms can then identify data points that do not fit into any cluster or belong to a small, sparse cluster. These data points are considered anomalies, and can be further investigated to determine the cause of the deviation from normal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique is density-based anomaly detection, where normal data is characterized by a high density of data points in a particular region, while anomalies are identified by their low density. Density-based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN, can be used to identify regions of high and low density, and then classify data points as normal or anomalous based on their proximity to regions of high or low density.\n",
